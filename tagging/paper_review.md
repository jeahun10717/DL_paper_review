### 1. End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers

#### Abstract

We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed compo- nents like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bi- partite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the re- lations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time perfor- mance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R- CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. More- over, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms com- petitive baselines. Training code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.
